# Weather-Dashboard
I have created a weather ddashboard where you can comee and search for a city and it will show you current weather, as well as a 5 day forcast.

For this project I used the Open Weather API to pull current and future weather data.

# Functionality

## On page load
You will be able to type any city name in the US into the search bar and hit the submit

## On submit
The page will be filled with weather information from the city searched by the user

## Live Page
